# Remove Win10 Apps

The built-in apps with Windows 10, like Windows Mail, Maps, and Xbox, are 
installed with the OS. You have no option to remove them. You still have the 
ability to remove them.

1) Get the uninstall script in this repo.
2) Double-click on it.
3) It will give a warning about an execute policy. This is a safety warning to 
  ensure you know what you're running. Press Y and Enter.
4) It should remove all built-in apps.

There are a couple more options commented out (like Store and Calculator) that 
I left in there. Remove the # in front of the lines to remove them too.

If you change your mind, follow the above steps, but replace step 1 with the
reinstall script in this repo.
